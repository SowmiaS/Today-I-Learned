**tip#1 : Sum can produce wrong results, when the sum is outside the range of that data type.**

When sum of Integers or any data type, make sure the sum of the inputs dont exceed the integer range.
for example , Integer range is  -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648. If sum of 2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,648 will give the result 4294967296 which is not in range of integer. so would get something within integer range as answer. So Be aware that sum can produce wrong results when it is outside the range of that data type.
